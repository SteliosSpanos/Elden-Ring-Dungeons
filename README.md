# Elden Ring Dungeons
I was inspired by my favourite videogame "Elden Ring" to try and create a dungeons crawling game based on its characters, weapons and bosses
with the knowledge I have. I didn't pay much attention to the game stats being balanced. I rather focused on making the code functional.

## What I Learned
- That was my introduction to early stages of game development and I found it very interesting.
- It was a great way to practice while also creating something fun.
- I realized the importance of OOP(Object Oriented Programming) and how it can be used in a more practical way.
